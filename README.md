# GEMification
GEMification is a serious game developed for my thesis "Gamification of genome-scale metabolic models", developed in Unity.

Welcome to GEMification, an interactive and educational game designed to make the complex world of bioinformatics and genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) accessible to learners. In this game, you step into the shoes of a bioinformatician working in a laboratory tasked with testing various gene modifications to optimize the production of specific products.

GEMification offers a hands-on experience, allowing players to manipulate organisms at the genomic level. You'll be deleting genes, creating under or over expressions of reactions, and more to achieve specific goals, such as survival in different conditions.

Built with simplicity in mind, GEMification is a point-and-click game that focuses on user-friendly interactions. No prior game development experience is required to navigate and enjoy the learning experience.

The game aims to clarify genome-scale metabolic models, providing a platform for bioinformatics beginners to understand the tools used in phenotype simulations. From gene and reaction research to calculating expression rates, the game simplifies these processes with a carefully explained UI system.

In order to play simply download the GEMification execution file and run it!

# DISCLAIMER
Currently there is a problem when performing certain tasks in the game that requires to run python files, for example, when clicking in the "Escher Map" button to display a pathway map. This process contains a C# script that runs a Python script, there is a problem with the location with this Python files as well as the location of the Python executer.
